# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

A lightweight machine learning project that predicts future stock closing prices using historical market data.  
This project focuses on understanding how financial time-series data can be transformed into features and used to train a regression model for price forecasting.

## 🔍 What This Project Includes
- Data loading and cleaning utilities  
- Technical indicators (MA5, MA10, price change %, etc.)  
- Random Forest regression model  
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, R²)  
- Script to generate predictions for the latest data  
- Notebook for data exploration and visualization  

## 🚀 Goal
